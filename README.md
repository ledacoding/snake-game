ABOUT THE GAME

This game corresponds to the classic snake game. Catch the apples to grow the snake but don't touch the borders or catch your tail. The bigger you get, the fastest you go!

ABOUT THE CREATOR

This game was part of the Scrimba bootcamp. I added some styling and changed the speed of the snake.
